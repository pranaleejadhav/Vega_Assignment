# Vega_Visualization

Please open index.html to view visualizations.

To create an  interactive  visualization  system  to  explore  the  cause  of  loss  indemnities  dataset  for 2015 available at http://www.rma.usda.gov/data/cause.html. 

The visualizations have been made in:
# Vega and
# Tableau.

# The visualization system should contain two views:

(1) a choropleth map on the left that shows state boundaries and uses a sequential segmented colormap to encode the total amount of losses, and 

(2) a bar chart on the right that expresses the amount of loss with aligned horizontal position and separates the damage type with vertical position. 
The marks are ordered by the loss amount attribute  that  encodes  the  size  of  the  bar.  
When  no  interaction  is  available  the  entire data  set  is used to generate the two views.

# Features:

Namely the colormap encodes the sum aggregated losses of all types of damage and the bar chart encodes the sum aggregated losses for all the states.

When  the user  hovers  over  a  state  on  the  left  view  then  the  bar chart  will  show  only  the  data  related  to  that  state.  Aggregation  of  losses  is  no  longer  over  the entire US, rather it is only over the highlighted state.

Also,  when  the  user  hovers  over  a  bar corresponding  to  a  specific  type  of  damage  then  the  map encodes only  the  data  related  to  that damage.  Aggregation  of  losses  is  no  longer  over  all  damage  types,  rather  it  is  only  over  the highlighted damage (e.g. Drought)
